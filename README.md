# React Developer Assessment

* An understanding of React syntax
* Working with an API
* Storing and manipulating React state
* Structuring an application with multiple components
* HTML and CSS ability
* Responsive web development ability

These are the minimum requirements for the exercies:

#### Retrieve the data from the mock API.
- [x] Output the data in a list, including properties from the data that are appropriate for a list view.
- [x] Implement a category filter - this can be single or multi-select.
- [x] Implement pagination - this can be traditional numbered pages or "load more".
- [x] Use semantic markup where possible.
- [x] Create a responsive layout with HTML and CSS, this must be suitable for use on a public-facing website. For example, a grid-based card layout.

#### Additional Exercises

If you have time then demonstrating any of the following would be considered as a bonus:

- [x] Use client-side routing to create a "detail" page.
- [ ] Persist filter state in the query string.
- [ ] Include animated transitions between application state, e.g. when filtering.
